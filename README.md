# API Final Project Documentation

# Description

The LittleLemon API is the final assignment for the [APIs Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/apis) part of the [Meta BackEnd Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-back-end-developer) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

The API endpoints for this project provide the functionality to create, edit and delete users, roles for each user, such as Customer, Delivery Crew or Manager, menu items, categories for menu items,  shopping cart, and orders. Every API endpoint has authorization and permissions constraints as well as throttling, pagination, and filtering.

## Project Structure

This project consists mainly of two apps, *littlelemon* and *api*.

**littlelemon app**

This app contains the models' definition to create the entity relationships required by the *api* app.

**api app**

This app contains the URLs dispatchers (routers), serializers, and views for every endpoint of the API. Additionally, it contains helpers classes that are inherited by class-based views.

**config dir**

This directory contains the configuration files of the project, such as the `settings.py` file and the `urls.py` file which contains the main URL dispatchers of the project.

## Installation

**Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eadwulf/littlelemon.git && cd littlelemon
```

**Create the virtual environment and install the dependencies**

```bash
pipenv install
```

Note that I use [Djoser](https://djoser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) but is included within the repository and not as a dependency. [Djoser](https://djoser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) has some bugs that create a compatibility error with the latest version of [DjangoRestFramework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/), I made the corrections that I needed and added it to the project as a local app to avoid such compatibility errors.

# Database Setup

The project uses a PostgreSQL database. Configured as follows

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': env('DATABASE_NAME'),
        'HOST': env('DATABASE_HOST'),
        'PORT': env('DATABASE_PORT'),
        'USER': env('DATABASE_USER'),
        'PASSWORD': env('DATABASE_PASSWORD'),
    },
}
```

<aside>
    üí° If you do not have an existing database and user to use with these settings, follow the
    instructions below and create new ones.
</aside>
<br>

### Enter The PostgreSQL Prompt

```sql
psql -U postgres -d postgres
```

### Create The Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;
```

### Create The User

```sql
CREATE USER <username> WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '<password>';
```

### Modifying Connection Parameters

```sql
ALTER ROLE <database_user> SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE <database_user> SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE <database_user> SET timezone TO 'UTC';
```

### Grant Permissions To The User

```sql
 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database_name> TO <username>;
```

### Exit The Prompt

```sql
\q
```
<br>


# Environment Variables

### Create The Environment Variables File **(.env)**

In the Django project directory *(chat-room-api/config/)*, create the **.env** file and add to it the following

```python
DEBUG=<boolean_value>
DATABASE_NAME=<your_database_name>
DATABASE_HOST=<your_database_host>
DATABASE_PORT=<your_database_port>
DATABASE_USER=<your_database_user>
DATABASE_PASSWORD=<your_database_password>
```
<aside>
    üí° Be aware that <em>django-environ</em> is required. Such dependency should be installed
    by running <em>pipenv install</em>
</aside>
<br>

### Apply the migrations

```python
python manage.py migrate
```

### Run the server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
<br>
<br>

# API endpoints and usage explanation

For the examples, I added code snippets for usage with curl, but feel free to use whatever tool suits you best. I also added filtering, searching, and ordering capabilities for some of the endpoints. The available fields for each endpoint are specified in the Endpoint section further below.

**filtering**

```bash
curl -X GET localhost:8000/api/menu-items?title=Latte \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

Note: *Filtering searches for an exact match of the passed string to the query parameter. It returns an empty list if no matches were found.*

**Searching**

```bash
curl -X GET localhost:8000/api/menu-items?search=coffe \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

Note: *Search searches for any match of the passed string in all the lookup fields defined for the endpoint. It is case insensitive and may return results than partially or exactly match the passed string. For the above example, if there is an object with a title ‚ÄúIrish Coffee‚Äù and another with a category ‚ÄúCoffee‚Äù, both of them will be returned.*

**Ordering**

```bash
curl -X GET localhost:8000/api/menu-items?ordering=price,title \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

Note: *Ordering sorts the returns elements by the given criteria, by default it does it in ascending order, but it can be reversed by appending the minus sign (-) before the ordering criteria. In the above example, the ordering criteria are price and title, therefore all the returned elements are sorted in ascending order by price and then by title.*

**Filtering, searching, and ordering together**

```bash
curl -X GET localhost:8000/api/menu-items?category=Coffee&search=coffee&ordering=price,title \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

All these functionalities can be used separately or in conjunction with one another. As shown in the above example, start appending the question mark (?), -after the endpoint URL-, add a query (such as ***search),*** and subsequently separate queries with an ampersand (&).

Here it is again:

```bash
?category=Coffee&search=coffee&ordering=-price,title
```

**Usage**:

```bash
curl -X GET localhost:8000/api/orders  \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"

curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/orders \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

*A **POST** request creates a new order with the order-items present in the user‚Äôs cart. This request creates purchase-items instances from the order-items, and adds them to a Purchase instance which will be added to an Order instance. The last step is to delete all the order-items from the cart.*

This procedure ensures that a user doesn‚Äôt add repeated menu-items to the order-items giving its unique together (user, menu-item) constraint and, once the order has been created, deletes the order-item allowing the user to create new orders with the same menu-items.
